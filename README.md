This python program utilizes the FPDF package to create an up to date cover letter that I can generate with every position that I apply to. 
This personal project is mostly to programmatically automate something in my daily life as a challenge which I enjoyed doing.

I made this modular so it can be updated easily to the newest version of my cover letter and still allow me to keep the date automatic as well as fill in certain details with each generation.

To run the program execute it on the command line with each additional argument being a word of the job title: 

`py ".\Cover Letter Generator.py" Junior Level Software Developer`
